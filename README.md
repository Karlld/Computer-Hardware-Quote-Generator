# Computer-Hardware-Quote-Generator
Computer Hardware Quote Generator from https://www.101computing.net/computer-hardware-quote-generator/

Have you ever wondered how computer manufacturers calculate the price of a custom PC? Or maybe you have dreamed of building your own computer but were not sure how much it would cost? In this Python challenge, you’ll step into the shoes of a computer builder! Your mission: write a program that lets users pick their ideal hardware components and generates a quote price for their custom computer.

Your Challenge
For this challenge you will create a Python program that:

Displays a menu of hardware options (e.g., screen size, RAM, CPU, storage).
Lets the user select their preferred components.
Calculates the total price based on their choices.
Outputs a detailed quote with the selected specifications and total cost.
Hardware Options
Your program should allow users to customise at least the following components:

Component	Options (with Base Prices)
Screen Size	13″ (£50), 15″ (£100), 17″ (£150)
RAM	8GB (£40), 16GB (£80), 32GB (£150)
CPU Clock Speed	2.5GHz (£100), 3.2GHz (£200), 4.0GHz (£350)
Storage	256GB HDD (£30), 512GB SSD (£60), 1TB SSD (£120)
Graphics Card	Integrated (£0), Dedicated (£150), High-End (£400)
